					<p>Hi I'm Wendy, from Abundant Living Mommy. My journey started 18 years ago. We live in a fast paced world with fast paced foods. You can go to any grocery store and just about every meal you can imagine is available frozen. How about the fast food restaurants on every corner? Delivery anyone? Maybe you run into the store and pick up something under the heat lamp.</p>
					<p>It's easy to see how this can happen. We work hard, fill our days from sun up to well beyond sun down, dragging ourselves to bed only to start it all over again a few hours later.</p>

			<p>1 in 2 Americans will get cancer. 36% of Americans are over weight. 34% Obese, this doubles the risk of heart disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes. It doesn't stop there. Alarming numbers of Americans are suffering autoimmune diseases, depression, anxiety, hormone problems, ADHD, fertility and many more. The last two decades my husband and I have changed our diet, too many times to count. We changed after his father had open heart surgery, to a low fat diet, after his mother was diagnosed with cancer, and when we wanted to lose weight. My diet also changed during pregnancy after I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.  My husband has been battling high blood pressure and recently I found out I have an autoimmune disorder, raised cholesterol and leaking gut. Whew............</p>

					<p>However, in all these diet changes and transformations our goal was always to eat the healthiest that we could. This is a real challenge in the world I described earlier. After the birth of our little miracle baby girl, anxiety overcame me. The gestational diabetes put my little girl at an increased risk of developing diabetes herself. In addition to all the hereditary diseases in our family, I had a C-Section(not planned) so she didn't receive any Flora. This helps start supporting her immune system. I started to research more and more about the foods we eat and the toxic world we live in.  The research that I found effects our food, environment, homes and even healthcare.  I started to educate myself and bacame an expert at reading labels and knowing about the ingredients in out food.</p>
					<p>I was shocked at what was in even organic foods. An ingredient like carrageen- which is used as a thinking agent is found in milk, cottage cheese, dog food, meats and even cosmetics.  Carrageen is a gut irritant causing inflammation and possibly cancer. At home I started looking at chemicals we use daily. Cleaners, dusting agents, weed killers and cookware. We all know the effects of BPA, but there are so many more unfriendly, harmful chemicals in our products causing a toxic environment.</p>

					<p>Kids toys you would think they would be safe right? Wrong! Many of the toys are imported from places like China with very poor regulations. These are the toys our children put in their mouths, lay on and play with.</p>
					<p>My quest started. I can't control every aspect of my families life. But, my goal is to try my best to create a toxic free environment and have the healthiest foods we can.</p>
					<p>I invite you to join me on this journey. I am a real mom with the same challenges you have. I have a messy, imperfect life. But everyday we are given, we have another opportunity to change, grow, transform ourselves and families. As woman we are the center of the home and have the opportunity to mold and teach. We have power in numbers. I would love to get to know you so we can encourage each other. As a wellness coach and mommy I have put together simple raw, healthy meals, as well as toxic free tips for your home and family. Lets do life together.</p>
